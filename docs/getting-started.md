# Getting Started
Create your first project named `my-app` by entering:
```console
npx hotstaq create my-app
```

Navigate into the newly created `my-app` directory, and run the development web server:
```console
cd my-app
npm start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:5000`. Open a web browser to that location, and you can see the welcome page.

In your `my-app` directory, open `public/index.hott` and change your landing page. Refresh your browser to see your changes immediately.
