# Getting Started

Get started by **installing HotStaq**.

```console
npm -g install hotstaq
```

Now we can **create a new app**.

## Creating a New App

Generate a new HotStaq app using **TypeScript**:

```console
hotstaq create my-app
```

## Start your site

Run the development web server:

```console
cd my-app

hotstaq start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:8080`.

Open `public/index.hott` and change your landing page. Refresh your browser to see your changes immediately.
