# FAQ

## Is this a replacement for React or Angular?
No. It can execute React or Angular applications. Additionally it can run along them as well.

## Does this work with Internet Explorer 11?
Not yet. This is unfortunately on the roadmap.

## Does this work with older web browsers prior to 2015?
It varies from browser to browser and how your application is made. If the browser supports ES6 and async/await it can typically execute HotStaq applications.

## How is this similar to PHP?
Both HotStaq and PHP are preprocessors, they parse and execute code to generate content. Biggest difference is PHP processes content on the server side, while HotStaq typically processes content on the client side. HotStaq is capable of processing content on the server-side, but this is not recommended for to performance and security considerations.
