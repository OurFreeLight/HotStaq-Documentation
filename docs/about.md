# What is HotStaq?
HotStaq is a client-side HTML preprocessor, with a design similar to that of PHP. This project started off originally as just a simple HTML preprocessor like PHP, but has grown into something much much more. 

It's capable of building full stack web-applications that can include both frontend and backend testing, along with application containerization.
